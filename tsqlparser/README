TSQL-PARSER 
-----------
An SQL parser with support for Temporal-Extension syntax. It is based on JSQLParser, 
with the added syntax support and rewrite capability, from standard SQL to Temporal
form.
It is intended to be used with Temporal JDBC Proxy to provide a full TSQL alternative.

Rewrite capability
------------------
Beside parsing the TSQL, the the parser can rewrite the TSQL queries to a standard SQL
form with added timestamps information.
Example:
From: INSERT INTO tab VALUES(1,"hello world",'this is me')
Into: INSERT INTO tab VALUES (1, "hello world",'this is me', now(), '2037-12-31 23:59:59.0')

From: DELETE FROM tab WHERE b="7"
Into: UPDATE tab SET tend=now() WHERE b = '7'

From: SELECT * FROM tab t1, tab t2 WHERE c=7 AND t1.a=t2.a
Into: SELECT * FROM tab AS t1 , tab AS t2 WHERE (c = 7 AND t1.a = t2.a)   AND t1.tend= '2037-12-31 23:59:59.0' AND t2.tend= '2037-12-31 23:59:59.0' 

Limitations
-----------
- Current supported DBMS: (MySQL, Postgres).
- Depending on the DBMS, TSQL-Parser generates different formats of timestamps in order to have a common granularity of microseconds:
	- MySQL: Timestamps are in a Decimal(20,6) form, where a date 2011-12-31 23:59:59.123456 is translated into 201112312359.123456
	- Postgres supports natively microseconds storage.
